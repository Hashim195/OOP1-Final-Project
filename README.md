# Hospital Management System - OOP1 Final Project

## Overview

This repository contains the final project for the **Object-Oriented Programming 1 (OOP1)** course. The project is a **Hospital Management System** that allows users to register doctors, patients, and perform other hospital-related operations. The application is built using **Java** and demonstrates key object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

The goal of this project is to simulate a simple hospital management system where users can interact with a menu to perform tasks like registering doctors, registering patients, and viewing records.

## Project Description

### Objective
The main objective of this project is to create a **Java-based console application** that simulates a hospital management system. The system allows users to:
- Register a new doctor.
- Register a new patient.
- View registered doctors and patients.
- Perform other hospital-related operations (if applicable).

The application is designed to be user-friendly and demonstrates a clear understanding of object-oriented programming principles.
